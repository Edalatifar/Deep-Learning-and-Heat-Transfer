# Dataset Usage
The dataset was saved in two formats, *.npz for python and *.mat for Matlab. *.mat. The files were compressed with WinZip, due to the large size of the files. ReadDataset_Python.py and ReadDataset_Matlab.m are examples of reading data using python and Matlab respectively. For using dataset in Matlab, please download Dataset/HeatTransferPhenomena_35_58.zip, unzip it, and then use ReadDataset_Matlab.m as an example. In the case of python, please download Dataset/HeatTransferPhenomena_35_58.npz and run ReadDataset_Python.py.
